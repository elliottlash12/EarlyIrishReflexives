CLEFT,The governing context for a potential reflexive marker is a cleft sentence. For example¢ in Wb.007d15 the potential reflexive marker is the 1st person pronominal marking in the constituent form féin ‘on myself’ which is found in the pivot position of the cleft sentence: isform féin doreg hitossuch ‘it is on myself that I will touch at first.’ This designation is important for tracking coreference across clausal boundaries¢ since cleft sentences consist of two clauses: the pivot (isform féin ‘it is on myself’) and the cleft or relative clause (doreg hitossuch ‘that I will touch at first’). The subject of the cleft clause may or may not be coreferential with an item in the pivot.,GOV CONTEXT TYPE,GOV CONTEXT
ELIDED,The governing context for a potential reflexive marker is a sentence that contains an elided constituent. For example¢ in Wb.030c17 the potential reflexive marker is the 3rd person pronominal marking in the constituent asenchassom fadesin ‘his own tradition’ which is the subject of an elided verb which can be identified by the governing context: nistuirmi recht act asenchassom fadesin ‘the Law records them not¢ but his own tradition [records them].’ This designation is important for tracking coreference across clausal boundaries¢ since elision usually occurs in the context of two clauses: the antecedent (nistuirmi recht ‘the law records them not’) and clause containing the elided constituent (act dos-rími asenchassom fadesin ‘but his tradition records them’).,GOV CONTEXT TYPE,GOV CONTEXT

VERB,The governing context for a potential reflexive marker is a clause headed by a verb.
