The csv files found here serve as the dataset for Lash, Elliott (forthcoming) 'Early Irish Reflexives', in Wolfgang Hock, Götz Keydana, and Paul Widmer (eds) *Reflexivity* [Mouton Handbooks of Indo-European Typology 2], De Gruyter.

The two main files are REFLEXIVE EXAMPLES.csv and REFLEXIVE LEMMAS.csv. The first collects possible reflexive examples from manuscripts written during the Old Irish period (600-900) and some examples found in later sources. 
The dataset is only supposed to be comprehensive for the Old Irish period.
The second file summarizes information about the lemmas of the verbs found in the reflexive examples cited in REFLEXIVE EXAMPLES.csv and gives information about other constructions (specifically transitive and non-reflexive intransitive) found with the same verb.

Three supplementary files (KEY TO COLUMNS IN REFLEXIVE EXAMPLES.csv, KEY TO TAGS IN REFLEXIVE EXAMPLES.csv, KEY TO COLUMNS IN REFLEXIVE LEMMAS.csv) provide information about how to read and use the information found in the two main files. They include an explanation of the tags and column headings and the interaction between particular tags and columns.

There is a fourth file (Deponents.csv) which provides the lemmas of three types of deponent verbs in Old Irish: primary, derived (by means of a zero-suffix) and semi-deponent. A fourth type, those derived from non-verbal roots using the suffix -aig are not listed, since this suffix is productive.

All of the files in this dataset are work in progress as of February 2024 and may be updated in the future.

Note that the symbol ¢ is used throughout the csv files as a placeholder for a comma.
